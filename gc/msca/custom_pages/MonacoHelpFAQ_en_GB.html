<div id="versionDifference">
  
  <h2 class="heading--medium">Q: What's the difference between 32- and 64-bit versions of Windows?</h2>
  
  <p>A: 32- and 64-bits refer to the way a computer's central processor (essentially, its brain) handles information.  Computers that contain 64-bit processors handle data in larger blocks, which makes them more efficient.  You can't put software designed for a 64-bit system on a 32-bit system, though &mdash; it won't work.</p>
  <p>To find out what type of system your computer is running:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click <b>Start</b>, right-click <b>Computer</b>, and then click <b>Properties</b>.</li>
    <li>The operating system appears as follows:</li>
    
<ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li>For a 64-bit version operating system, "64-bit Operating System" appears under <b>System Type</b>.</li>
      <li>For a 32-bit version operating system, "32-bit Operating System" appears under <b>System Type</b>.</li>
